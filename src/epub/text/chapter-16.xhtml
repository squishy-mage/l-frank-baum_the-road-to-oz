			<p>“Ah!” cried the shaggy man, springing to his feet with eager joy; “we’ve found it at last.”</p>
			<p>“Found what?” asked Dorothy, running to him.</p>
			<p>“The Truth Pond. Now, at last, I may get rid of this frightful head; for we were told, you remember, that only the Truth Pond could restore to me my proper face.”</p>
			<p>“Me, too!” shouted Button-Bright, trotting up to them.</p>
			<p>“Of course,” said Dorothy. “It will cure you both of your bad heads, I guess. Isn’t it lucky we found it?”</p>
			<p>“It is, indeed,” replied the shaggy man. “I hated dreadfully to go to Princess Ozma looking like this; and she’s to have a birthday celebration, too.”</p>
			<p>Just then a splash startled them, for Button-Bright, in his anxiety to see the pool that would “cure” him, had stepped too near the edge and tumbled heels over head into the water. Down he went, out of sight entirely, so that only his sailor hat floated on the top of the Truth Pond.</p>
			<p>He soon bobbed up, and the shaggy man seized him by his sailor collar and dragged him to the shore, dripping and gasping for breath. They all looked upon the boy wonderingly, for the fox head with its sharp nose and pointed ears was gone, and in its place appeared the chubby round face and blue eyes and pretty curls that had belonged to Button-Bright before King Dox of Foxville transformed him.</p>
			<p>“Oh, what a darling!” cried Polly, and would have hugged the little one had he not been so wet.</p>
			<p>Their joyful exclamations made the child rub the water out of his eyes and look at his friends questioningly.</p>
			<p>“You’re all right now, dear,” said Dorothy. “Come and look at yourself.” She led him to the pool, and although there were still a few ripples on the surface of the water he could see his reflection plainly.</p>
			<p>“It’s me!” he said, in a pleased yet awed whisper.</p>
			<p>“ ‘Course it is,” replied the girl, “and we’re all as glad as you are, Button-Bright.”</p>
			<p>“Well,” announced the shaggy man, “it’s my turn next.” He took off his shaggy coat and laid it on the grass and dived head first into the Truth Pond.</p>
			<p>When he came up the donkey head had disappeared, and the shaggy man’s own shaggy head was in its place, with the water dripping in little streams from his shaggy whiskers. He scrambled ashore and shook himself to get off some of the wet, and then leaned over the pool to look admiringly at his reflected face.</p>
			<p>“I may not be strictly beautiful, even now,” he said to his companions, who watched him with smiling faces; “but I’m so much handsomer than any donkey that I feel as proud as I can be.”</p>
			<p>“You’re all right, Shaggy Man,” declared Dorothy. “And Button-Bright is all right, too. So let’s thank the Truth Pond for being so nice, and start on our journey to the Emerald City.”</p>
			<p>“I hate to leave it,” murmured the shaggy man, with a sigh. “A truth pond wouldn’t be a bad thing to carry around with us.” But he put on his coat and started with the others in search of some one to direct them on their way.</p>
