			<p>When noon came they opened the Fox-King’s basket of luncheon, and found a nice roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and some slices of bread and butter. As they sat on the grass by the roadside the shaggy man cut up the turkey with his pocket-knife and passed slices of it around.</p>
			<p>“Haven’t you any dewdrops, or mist-cakes, or cloudbuns?” asked Polychrome, longingly.</p>
			<p>“ ‘Course not,” replied Dorothy. “We eat solid things, down here on the earth. But there’s a bottle of cold tea. Try some, won’t you?”</p>
			<p>The Rainbow’s Daughter watched Button-Bright devour one leg of the turkey.</p>
			<p>“Is it good?” she asked.</p>
			<p>He nodded.</p>
			<p>“Do you think I could eat it?”</p>
			<p>“Not this,” said Button-Bright.</p>
			<p>“But I mean another piece?”</p>
			<p>“Don’t know,” he replied.</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m going to try, for I’m very hungry,” she decided, and took a thin slice of the white breast of turkey which the shaggy man cut for her, as well as a bit of bread and butter. When she tasted it Polychrome thought the turkey was good⁠—better even than mist-cakes; but a little satisfied her hunger and she finished with a tiny sip of cold tea.</p>
			<p>“That’s about as much as a fly would eat,” said Dorothy, who was making a good meal herself. “But I know some people in Oz who eat nothing at all.”</p>
			<p>“Who are they?” inquired the shaggy man.</p>
			<p>“One is a scarecrow who’s stuffed with straw, and the other a woodman made out of tin. They haven’t any appetites inside of ’em, you see; so they never eat anything at all.”</p>
			<p>“Are they alive?” asked Button-Bright.</p>
			<p>“Oh yes,” replied Dorothy; “and they’re very clever and very nice, too. If we get to Oz I’ll introduce them to you.”</p>
			<p>“Do you really expect to get to Oz?” inquired the shaggy man, taking a drink of cold tea.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know just what to ‘spect,” answered the child, seriously; “but I’ve noticed if I happen to get lost I’m almost sure to come to the Land of Oz in the end, somehow ’r other; so I may get there this time. But I can’t promise, you know; all I can do is wait and see.”</p>
			<p>“Will the Scarecrow scare me?” asked Button-Bright.</p>
			<p>“No; ‘cause you’re not a crow,” she returned. “He has the loveliest smile you ever saw⁠—only it’s painted on and he can’t help it.”</p>
			<p>Luncheon being over they started again upon their journey, the shaggy man, Dorothy and Button-Bright walking soberly along, side by side, and the Rainbow’s Daughter dancing merrily before them.</p>
			<p>Sometimes she darted along the road so swiftly that she was nearly out of sight, then she came tripping back to greet them with her silvery laughter. But once she came back more sedately, to say:</p>
			<p>“There’s a city a little way off.”</p>
			<p>“I ‘spected that,” returned Dorothy; “for the fox-people warned us there was one on this road. It’s filled with stupid beasts of some sort, but we musn’t be afraid of ’em ‘cause they won’t hurt us.”</p>
			<p>“All right,” said Button-Bright; but Polychrome didn’t know whether it was all right or not.</p>
			<p>“It’s a big city,” she said, “and the road runs straight through it.”</p>
			<p>“Never mind,” said the shaggy man; “as long as I carry the Love Magnet every living thing will love me, and you may be sure I shan’t allow any of my friends to be harmed in any way.”</p>
			<p>This comforted them somewhat, and they moved on again. Pretty soon they came to a signpost that read:</p>
